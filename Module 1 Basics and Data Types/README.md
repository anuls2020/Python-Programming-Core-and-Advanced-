How to add a new folder inside a github repository:

* On Github you can do it this way:
* Go to the folder within which you would like to make another folder.
* Click on **New file**.
* On the text field for the file name, first, write the folder name you want to create then type /.....
* After typing /give the file name. If no file name,Just give "README.md" which will create a new folder and a new file with that specified namein that location. 
* Later on we can add more files inside the folder, either by creating it or by uploading it.
